# odin-admin-dashboard
Part of The Odin Project Portfolio project in JS Path, the last of Intermediate HTML &amp; CSS Lessons

I simply left icons as the way they are because The Project said to focus on Grid, and I don't know the destinations if I gave them links anyway.

It was an amazing experience, I didn't think I could finish this, to be honest, but yet here I am.
I hope your journey will be as meaningful as well.

The Icons here were acquired from Google icons and pictogrammers (the same as the project briefs).
The profile pictures are characters from Wuthering Waves, a game by Kuro Games.
